# Hygroscopic-Atmospheric-Water-Collector
A device that uses a cycle to extract water without refrigeration: 1. Dry Hygroscopic media extracts water from air! We force air throught it with a positive displacement pump. 2. Sensor detects Saturation level. When the system has reached max absorbtion? It shuts down and closes the air valve. 3. Use Heat to evaporate the water and condense it.
